# elementin

 this is an application which gives us information on the element given in the input.

# Architecture

this application is having two points in its architecture. the client and the server. server is at [http://elements-api.herokuapp.com/](http://elements-api.herokuapp.com/)

To fireup the frontend, navigate to the public folder using `cd public` and install the npm package as live-server using `nodemon install -g live-server`, (prefix with sudo `sudo npm i -g live-server` on a mac computer), and in the public folder, open terminal and write `live-server`, and your full fledged application would run on port 5050.

# how is the app created

The app is created mainly using node.js as the backend server, and at the frontend, we have used html, css and vanilla javascript. As the database, we have used mongoDb.
